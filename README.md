# LoveBirds
It is a messaging app similar to popular messaging app Whatsapp, built with UIKit and swift, where I used Firebase Firestore to store and retrieve messages from the cloud. Used Cocoapods for third party libraries (IQKeyboardManager, CLTypingLabel).

# Purpose behind these features:
Now the App finally fulfills the purpose of being a private messaging App for just two people at the same time, which only happens if the two peoples involved mutually decide to establish communication between each other. QR Code Scan process helps it to establish that functionality.
# New libraries used:
1. AVFoundation
2. VisionKit
3. CoreImage
4. CoreData
